            <p class="history"><b>Alluri Sitarama Raju</b>, (4 July 1897 or 1898 Pandrangi Andhra Pradesh, 7 May 1924 (aged 25 or 26) Koyyuru, Andhra Pradesh), was an Indian revolutionary, who waged an armed campaign against the British colonial rule in India. 
                Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh,  Rampa Rebellion of 1922, in which Alluri sita rama raju played the major role as its leader. Mustering combined forces of Adivasis, farmers and other sympathizers to the cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British in the border regions of then Madras Presidency, 
                now parts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam. He was given the Title —"Manyam Veerudu" (Hero of the Jungle) by the local villagers for his heroic exploits.<br><br><br>

                Around this time, he became a friend of a rich man and developed platonic love for his friend's sister named Sita, whose untimely demise left him heartbroken. 
                To make her memory eternal, Rama Raju then prefixed her name to his, and came to be popularly known as Sita Rama Raju.. He however later gave up his schooling, but privately mastered the literature of Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi and English languages. Contemporary reports indicate that although he had an undistinguished education,
                 he took a particular interest in astrology, herbalism, palmistry and equestrianism, before becoming a sannyasi at the age of 18. <br><br><br>
                 
                 
                 
                 <p class="history">In 1921 he visited Gangotri and Nashik, birthplaces of the holy rivers—Ganga and Godavari. During his travels in the country, he met various revolutionaries in Chittagong; on seeing the socio-economic conditions of people, particularly those of the tribals, he was severely appalled and decided to build a movement for their independence from British rule.
                  He then settled down in the Papi hills near Godavari District, an area with a high density of tribal people especiall Koyyas(Tribal People).
                  Noting the grievances of the tribals and finding solutions to their problems, he started to organise and educate them about their rights, and prepared them for a fight against the oppression and tyranny of the forest and revenue officials, missionaries and police. <br> <br>

                  With his supporters, Alluri built a strong and powerful troops of fighters. Sporting traditional weaponry like bow-and-arrow and spears, and employing tactics like using whistles and beating drums to exchange messages amongst themselves,
                  Between 22 and 24 August 1922, Alluri led a troop of 500 people in the raid and plunder of police stations at Chintapalli, Krishnadevipeta and Rajavomangi. He gained possession of various weaponry from the seize—including 26 muskets, 2,500 rounds of ammunition, 
                  six .303 Lee Enfield Rifles and one revolver. <b> A hallmark of these raids was that after each attack, he would sign a letter in the stations diary, giving details of the plunder there, complete with the date and time of his attack, and dare the police to stop him if they can.</b> <br> <br> <br> </p>


                  
                  <p class="history">Over ₹4 million was spent in those days to defeat him speaks for itself. After putting up a massive effort for nearly two years, the British eventually managed to capture Alluri in the forests of Chintapalle, he was then tied to a tree, and summarily executed by shooting on 7 May 1924 in the village of Koyyuru.
                  The tomb of Alluri currently lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta, near Visakhapatnam. And that's how his legacy ended. <br> <br>
                  Mahatma Gandhi paid his tribute to Alluri's life, saying, "Though I do not approve of his armed rebellion, I pay my homage to his bravery and sacrifice." Jawaharlal Nehru commented that, "Raju was one of those few heroes that could be counted on fingers." Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose noted that Alluri was fierce in his determination, 
                  and his unparalleled courage and sacrifice for people will ensure him a place in history</p>
